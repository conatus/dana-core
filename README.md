## Developer quickstart

Nothing unorthodox here. Clone, run yarn to install dependencies and `yarn start` to run everything.

If you use vscode, you can optionally clone and run this repository in a development container. The GUI is accessible over vnc on port 5901 (password: vscode).

##Â Release workflow.

To cut a new release, create a tag and push it. Binaries will be built on our CI server for supported platforms.
